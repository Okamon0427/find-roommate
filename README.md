## Inspiration
One of the hardest parts about student housing is finding the best roommates for you. However that poses a challenge, because you're friends aren't always the best choice and its difficult to find people elsewhere. Social media and websites like Kijiji have become popular but have security and privacy risks when interacting with strangers. Our website aims to combat that by providing a safe option to finding roommates!

## What it does
Roommate squared is a website that connects you with other people looking for roommates. It's an alternative to using social media or websites like kijiji that may pose security or privacy risks.
